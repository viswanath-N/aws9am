			application



On-Demand ec2 instances : Unpredictable workloads / usecases.. If you want to test your applciation.. Temporary usage.. 
Pricing : /sec  or /hr basis we will get charged..  (with min of 60 Sec billing)

Reserved ec2 Instances : Predictable workload/ use cases.. Long time runs with AWS..
1 Yr / 3Yrs.. 
	--> Standard RI : We cannot change the instance configuration.. 
	--> Convertable RI : We can change the config.. 
	--> Scheduled RI : Repeated / persistant requests.. 

Pricing : Full Upfront : Pay 100% and get your instance.. 
	  Partial Upfront : Pay 30-50% now.. Remaining Monthly basis with reduced hr 				price
	  No Upfront : No need to pay anything.. Pay everything monthly basis..

Spot Instances : We can bid against the AWS price. If our quoted price is Equal to aws or greater than aws, we will get the instance.. 
--> If we have flexible start / stop time for our application.. 
--> If price increased AWS terminates the instance.
--> High configuration instances we will get at low cost.

t2.large : 1 $/Hr... You can bit against aws price.. 0.50$/hr fromdate/todate..

Windows Instance Launch and connectivity: 

Step 1: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)	:	Required OS : Windows 2016
AMI : Template of an OS, Applciation, softwares to run the instance.

Step 2 : Choose an Instance Type : Selecting the configuration (vCPU, Memory, Network Perf)

General Purpose 	: t2, t3, m4, m5	: t2.micro (Free tier)
Memory Optimised 	: r4, r5, r5ad , x1
Storage Optimized 	: d2, i2, i3
Compute Optimized 	: c4, c5, c4n, c5d	: (c5.xlarge 4CPU 8GBRAM) 
						  (c4.2xlarge 8vCPU 15GB RAM)
GPU Instances 		: P4, G2
FPGA (Field programable Gateway Array) : f1
ML ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) : inf1


Step 3: Configure Instance Details

No of INstance 			: 1
Shutdown behavior 		: Stop / Terminate
Enable termination protection 	: Yes (Protect against accidental termination)

Step 4: Add Storage 	: HDD

Step 5: Add Tags 	: Provide your metadata

Step 6: Configure Security Group 

Windows :  RDP : 3389 : MyIP
Linux : SSH : 22 : 

Source :  	Everywhere/anywhere : 0.0.0.0/0
		MyIP : Currently connected network IP : 
		Custom : Custom Network IPs

Step 7: Review and Launch.. 

Username : Administrator
password : Autogenerates Using Public Key and Private Key  (.pem file)

Public Key : AWS Stores this : Encrypt  
Private Key : We will get this private key : Decrypt  : .PEM


AWS ENvironment : 
We need to use "PUBLIC IP / DNS", Not "private IP"
Public IP : Unique across the globe.


Connect : 
1. open "Run" --> mstsc
2. click on "start" --> "Remote Desktop Connection"
3. Slect instance --> Action --> Connect --> Download Remote Desktop file.


Task : 

Every windows instance comes with 2 RDP Licenses.. 

ALong with Administror... Create another user "yourname" --> Provide "Local Admin Rights"
and Provide "RDP Permissions".

Login as "Yourname" to ec2 instance.
